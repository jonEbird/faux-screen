** TODO Spawn a New, Un-managed Terminal
  [2014-10-07 Tue 21:20]

I already occasionally like to spawn a quick throw away terminal. Perhaps
it's the wrong habit, given the fact that I've created this Faux Terminal
features of keeping terminals open, but nonetheless I think it would be
good to do a minor refactoring to have a separate function that is
designated for starting terminals. Can then specifically refactor
faux-screen-terminals to use it.
